# Privacy Policy for OmniAI

**Last Updated: September 26, 2025**

## Our Commitment to Your Privacy

Welcome to OmniAI! Your privacy is our top priority. This app is designed to be a simple, secure portal to third-party web services. We want to be completely transparent about what our app does and, more importantly, what it does not do.

**Our core principle is simple: We do not collect, store, or share any of your personal information for our own purposes.**

## 1. No User Accounts or Data Collection by OmniAI

OmniAI does not have its own login or account system. We do not ask for your name, email address, or any other personal details. The app functions as a specialized browser, and any account you log into is with a third-party service (like ChatGPT, for example) that is loaded within the app's web view. Your relationship with that third-party service is governed by their own privacy policy.

We do not collect or have access to:
*   Your login credentials (passwords) for any third-party service.
*   The content you create, upload, or share on those services.
*   Your browsing history within the web view.

## 2. Persistent Login and Session Management

To provide a seamless and convenient experience, OmniAI offers a persistent login feature. This means that when you log into a service (like Google for ChatGPT), we will help you stay logged in for your next session. Here’s how it works:

*   **Session Cookies**: We save the session cookies from the websites you log into. These cookies are small pieces of data that the website uses to recognize you and keep you logged in. They are stored securely on your device.
*   **OAuth Tokens**: For services that use OAuth for authentication, we may store the authentication tokens on your device. These tokens are like a digital key that proves you have already authenticated with the service.

**We want to be crystal clear: we never store your password.** We only store the session information that allows you to avoid logging in every time you open the app. You have full control over this feature and can clear your session data at any time from the app's settings.

## 3. Permissions We Request

To provide a rich web experience, our Android application requests a limited set of permissions. Here’s why we need them:

*   **`INTERNET` and `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`**: These permissions are essential for the app to connect to the internet. The app cannot function without them.
*   **`CAMERA`**: We request this permission so that websites you visit within the app can ask for camera access for features like video calls or uploading a profile picture. The app itself does not use your camera; it only enables the website to request access, which you can approve or deny.
*   **`RECORD_AUDIO`**: This permission is needed so that websites can ask for microphone access for features like voice commands or audio calls. The app itself does not use your microphone; it only enables the website to request access.
*   **`MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS`**: This permission allows the app to adjust audio settings to provide a better experience for media playback or calls initiated by the website.
*   **`READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`, `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO`, `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO`**: These permissions allow you to upload your own images, videos, and audio files to the websites you visit. The app only helps you select a file when a website requests it; we do not see or store the files you choose.
*   **`READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` (for older Android versions)**: On older versions of Android, this permission is required to access files from your device's storage for uploading.
*   **`WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`**: This permission is required to download AI-generated images, videos, and other file types to your device's external storage.
*   **`MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`**: This permission allows the app to manage files in your device's external storage, enabling the download and organization of AI-generated content.
*   **`WAKE_LOCK`**: This permission is used to prevent the screen from turning off during activities like video playback within the web view.
*   **`VIBRATE`**: This permission is used to provide haptic feedback for notifications or actions initiated by the website.

## 4. Data Security

The security of your session data is a top priority. All session information is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

If we ever change our app's functionality in a way that impacts your privacy, we will update this policy to reflect those changes.
